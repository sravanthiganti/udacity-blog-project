# udacity-blog-project

### Course project
 
In this project I utilized HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. 
Along with webpage design considerations, I also worked on appropriately structure files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.
